This chapter comprehensively examines the various stages involved in creating a custom human pose estimation dataset. The initial phase introduces the solution proposal and detials regarding the whole process. The following phase leverages existing models outlined in \in{Section}[section:existing-nns] (on \at{page}[section:existing-nns]). Subsequently, these models are integrated into a unified tool for custom dataset creation. Additionally, the tool's performance is evaluated using three metrics, \OKS\, \APE\ and \MSE\.

Throughout this thesis, several implementation challenges emerged, leading to certain technical limitations outlined in a dedicated \in{Section}[section:problems-limitations] on \at{page}[section:problems-limitations].

\pkap[section:proposal]{Solution Proposal}
This section will propose solutions for the specific dataset generation using existing {\bf \NN} detection models. The content of this section outlines one of the possible solutions, grounded in the analysis from the preceding paper chapter. It specifies the technologies that should be used and explains their suitability for this task.

The preceding chapter conducted an in-depth analysis of the current market landscape, exploring available technologies and datasets, along with their inherent limitations. As highlighted in \in{Section}[section:pose-estimation-challenges], existing datasets lack the complexity and robustness necessary for training a comprehensive detection model capable of excelling in production environments.

To address this shortfall, the concept of a cost-efficient method for generating a tailored dataset using open-source tools and models was explored. In selecting the technological foundation, {\bf Python} emerged as a prime choice due to its widespread adoption in data processing and machine learning endeavors. Python offers an extensive array of libraries such as {\bf Numpy} for numerical computations, {\bf Pandas} for data manipulation and analysis, and deep learning frameworks like {\bf PyTorch} and {\bf TensorFlow}. This rich ecosystem not only simplifies the implementation of complex algorithms but also fosters innovation and efficiency in dataset generation processes.

Initially, the production data undergoes the execution of existing models designed to detect human instances and estimate their poses. Namely, these include {\bf PoseNet}, {\bf MoveNet}, and {\bf MMPose} models described in the Sections \in[section:movenet], \in[section:posenet], and \in[section:mmpose]. The primary reason for the application of these models is outlined in \in{Section}[section:existing-nns], which includes the models' hardware requirements and their ease of implementability in Python, the underlying technology proposed in this section. Following the execution, multiple detection formats become available. It is crucial to propose a Unified Format for these detections, considering their respective keypoint structures and identifying a common skeleton. Once the Unified Format is established, the process of unification can commence, utilizing the existing detections from the initial step.

Subsequently, the sequential processing of these detections becomes essential, wherein corresponding frames are loaded from each detection model. Subsequent steps involve matching individual human instances, accomplished through comparison of instance {\bf \BBOX}-es or individual keypoint analysis. Once instances are paired, aggregation occurs, with methods varying from weighted to simple averaging based on the utilized models and their respective accuracy levels.

This process leads to the complete dataset processing, resulting in aggregated detection results. Processing one source frame at a time transforms all detections from individual models into the Unified Format.

Finally, evaluation becomes necessary, comparing the Unified Format against an annotated dataset (with a similar skeleton as the Unified Format), providing ground truth data for assessment. For evaluation, several metrics need inclusion to cover the overall performance of this Unified Format, including the {\bf \APE}, {\bf \MSE}, and {\bf \OKS} metrics.

A significant advantage of this approach lies in its flexibility; it is not restricted to specific models and can be fully customized to suit specific requirements. This implies the ability to combine any available detection model (or any number of detection models) and use them in the dataset generation process. The usage of existing models does not need to be confined to Python scripts introduced in this thesis. The only condition is to run the detection on some production data and prepare the results for the unification process.

The moment has arrived to delve into the realm of implementation. Within this section, an overview of the entire process will be presented, aiming to enhance comprehension of the thesis as a cohesive entity. Central to this elucidation will be the graphical representation of the sequential steps undertaken in this thesis. Each of these steps will be comprehensively expounded upon in subsequent sections, offering detailed insights into their execution.

To elucidate the process further, refer to \in{Figure}[overall-process]. The initial phase entails employing the existing skeleton detection models outlined in Sections \in[section:movenet], \in[section:posenet], and \in[section:mmpose]. This step involves the utilization of custom-implemented scripts designed to execute detections using the aforementioned models, as elaborated in the subsequent \in{Section}[section:individual-models-detection]. The detection process is conducted on the evaluation subset comprising 5,000 images from the COCO dataset. Outputs from individual detections are stored in distinct JSON files, the format of which is detailed in \in{Code}[code:detection-script-output].

These JSON files serve as inputs for the Unification script, which also requires keypoint map files for each detection model. These map files facilitate the transformation of native model outputs into the Unified Format mandated by the script. The Unification script aggregates individual detections into a specified format, generating a JSON file for each image (or video, depending on the script argument). Optionally, these Unified Format JSON files can be utilized for detection rendering, a functionality provided by the custom Render script.

Concurrently, the COCO WholeBody annotations (comprising 133 keypoints) undergo processing in a custom script. This script takes a single JSON file containing annotations for the entire subset (either training or validation) and produces individual JSON outputs for each image within the subset. Additionally, it generates detections in the same format as the Unification script, consolidating annotations for various body parts into a simplified 27 keypoint format. Optionally, these annotations can be rendered onto the subset images for visual analysis.

The final step entails evaluating the performance of the Unified Format. For this purpose, a custom script is employed, which compares the annotations (ground truth) with the Unified Format detections (predictions), calculating various statistical metrics detailed in \in{Section}[section:evaluation].

\pkap[section:individual-models-detection]{Individual Models Detection}
This section introduces an approach to implementing individual model detection. It details key concepts and tools for creating complex detection scripts in the {\bf Python} programming language.

The primary tool for implementation is Python and its extensive libraries. The following libraries were used in the initial step of creating detection scripts for individual models:

\startitemize[n]
    \item PoseNet:
        \startitemize[1]
            \item {\bf {\em Mediapipe}} - A~library providing the PoseNet model and tools for drawing detections on images.
        \stopitemize
    \item MoveNet:
        \startitemize[1]
            \item {\bf {\em Tensorflow}} - A~library used for working with image data structures.
            \item {\bf {\em Tensorflow Hub}} - A~repository of pre-trained machine learning models containing the MoveNet model.
        \stopitemize
    \item MMPose:
        \startitemize[1]
            \item {\bf {\em MMCV}} - A~foundational library for computer vision research.
            \item {\bf {\em MMPOSE}} - An open-source toolbox for pose estimation based on {\bf PyTorch}.
            \item {\bf {\em MMDET}} - An open-source object detection toolbox based on {\bf PyTorch}.
        \stopitemize
\stopitemize

Several other libraries are employed in the scripts to furnish essential functionality. Here is a list of the most crucial libraries: {\bf OS}, {\bf Sys}, {\bf OpenCV} and {\bf Numpy}. Additionally, the {\bf typing} library serves as a helper, primarily aimed at providing type hints and enhancing clarity regarding input/output structures. For this purpose, custom datatypes were devised, namely:

\sourcecode[][code:data-types]{Custom Datatypes}{}{src:data-types}{}

These custom datatypes address the detection output format and are organized hierarchically. The first, {\bf DetectionInstance}, represents a single human instance in the image, containing a list of keypoints, as described in \in{Subsection}[subsection:individual-models-detection]. Then follows the {\bf Frame}, which is a list of {\em detection instances}. At the top of this hierarchy lies the {\bf Detection} itself, which is a dictionary of the {\em frames}. Lastly, the final custom datatype, {\bf SkeletonEdgesPainting}, is a structure devised to store skeleton colour codes, assigning a single colour to each keypoint pair.

All these custom datatypes are utilized across various scripts to support type hints and enhance clarity regarding the utilized data structures. Subsequent references will be made to these types.

The main idea behind all detection scripts is to provide a very similar interface with the same functionality. Each detection model uses different resources, meaning the detection part itself is different for every case and needs to be implemented separately. Similarly, the model initialization parts are different. However, the script skeleton remains the same for every model.

The scripts utilize common custom functions gathered in the {\em utils} package. These methods manipulate images to provide the same frame format for every model. Additionally, they include helper functions for processing script arguments, such as handling processed file paths, output file names, and exporting detections to JSON files. Notably, the functions for drawing keypoints and skeletons on detected human instances are specific to the MoveNet model, as there is no library with this functionality for MoveNet, unlike the other two models.

See the script structure in the following code:

\sourcecode[][code:detection-script-backbone]{Simplified Detection Script Backbone (Pseudocode)}{}{src:detection-script-backbone}{}

The detection scripts process various file types based on the provided program arguments. They accept both image and video files. If the input is a directory, the script iterates through all video and image files within it, executing detection on each. Refer to the single-frame detection function \in{Code}[code:detection-script-frame] for a deeper understanding of the core detection implementation.

\sourcecode[][code:detection-script-frame]{Python Implementation of MoveNet Detection Function.}{}{src:detection-script-frame}{}

This function demonstrates the concept behind image detection execution for the MoveNet model. Similar approaches are used for MMPose and PoseNet models, with variations in the specific detection implementation and visualization. The first task is to load the frame or image. Optionally, a function for resizing the frame is available if it's too large. Then follows the pose detection itself. Program arguments manage actions like saving the detection file (JSON), the frame with drawn detections, and displaying the drawn detection frame. Optionally, correctly formatted detections are exported to a JSON file. The functions for drawing the detections onto the frame are then executed, followed by optional saving or displaying of the frame.

% ------- Sub-section ------- %
\ppkap[subsection:individual-models-detection]{Detection Format}
This subsection will take a close look into the individual detection models output format which is crucial for further processing and creation of Unified Format described in the \in{Section}[section:unified-format] on \at{page}[section:unified-format].

The detection scripts described in the previous section produce the same detection output format for every detection model. To understand the detection JSON file format, see the following example:

\sourcecode[][code:detection-script-output]{Detection Script Output Format (Example)}{}{src:detection-script-output}{}

This format pertains to the {\em single-frame} detection mode. When conducting detection on a video file without the {\em ---single--frame--output} option, the entire detection process is encapsulated within an additional dictionary to distinguish individual video frames. However, for this thesis, which focuses on dataset creation, there is no necessity to save the frame sequence. The {\em---single--frame--output} argument was implemented to segment the video file into individual frames and generate dedicated images for easily processed detection files.

The top level of the output format example includes a {\bf list} of {\bf detection instances} (objects). Each detection instance consists of the keypoints {\bf list}. The number of keypoints varies depending on the chosen detection model. A~single {\bf keypoint} is represented by a {\bf list} of three {\bf float} values. The first two values represent the {\bf coordinates} in pixels, and the last value signifies the {\bf visibility}. Additionally, the MMPose model produces the \BBOX\ position for the instance which is not present in the other model's output.

% ------- Section ------- %
\pkap[section:unified-format]{Created Unified Format}
A~highly cost-effective method of obtaining a custom dataset with real-life footage data is to leverage existing \NN\-s to generate labels. This approach enables the training of a new model specifically tailored to the target detection task. However, for effective training, a Unified Format is required to aggregate the results of these individual models. This section precisely addresses the concept of a Unified Format introduced in this thesis, capitalizing on the strengths of existing models. As explained in the previous chapter, each model estimates a different number of keypoints, emphasizing different qualities. Refer to \in{Table}[tab:format-comparison] for a comprehensive understanding of these differences.

The rationale behind the Unified Format is to identify commonalities among individual formats and address their variations. Essentially, the common format is based on {\bf MoveNet}, which comprises {\bf 17} keypoints, excluding {\em hands} and {\em feet} estimation compared to the Unified Format. {\bf PoseNet} introduces additional eye keypoints (compared to Unified Format) that need elimination, while {\bf MMPose} includes {\bf 107} unnecessary keypoints, particularly detailed facial keypoints and non-crucial hand keypoints (individual joints of each finger). The Unified Format optimally encompasses {\bf 27} keypoints, providing satisfactory detail for hands, feet, and face. Refer to \in{Figure}[unified-format-structure] for a visual representation of the structure. You can see that the format is straightforward. It offers basic pose representation with sufficient detail to both hands and feet.

Another crucial aspect is the accurate aggregation of individual model estimations, encompassing both the coordinates of keypoints and their visibility values. To address this, we introduce a weighted average, mitigating weaknesses in faster models such as MoveNet and PoseNet. Given that these models are designed for real-time estimation, and we utilize the "lightning" model version for PoseNet, accuracy is inherently limited. Detailed values for the weighted average are available in \in{Table}[tab:format-comparison]. The assignment of the highest weight to the {\bf MMPose} model is justified by its superior accuracy with \APE\ metric described in the \in{Section}[section:evaluation]. This approach ensures the uniformity of estimations made by individual models across the entire dataset, as prepared in the previous section.

\obrazek{unified-format-structure}{Unified format structure with IDs to each keypoint}{figures/unified-detection-structure.png}{width=\makeupwidth}

The weighted average is not applied in scenarios involving the processing of keypoints on the hands or feet. This limitation arises from the fact that the {\bf MoveNet} model does not provide these keypoints, necessitating a basic average calculation of the two values. In other words, the weighted average is applied only when there is data from all three models.

To clarify and explain the detection outcomes, refer to Figures \in[compose-fig:coco-detection], \in[compose-fig:mmpose-detection] and \in[compose-fig:unified-detection]. The initial depiction presents the original COCO WholeBody annotations in a simplified format, mirroring the Unified Format with 27 keypoints. All individuals within the image are annotated, meticulously considering the overlap and occlusion of human figures. Additionally, non-visible skeleton edges are omitted. Notably, no facial keypoints are detected, aligning with the absence of visible faces, thus demonstrating accurate annotation.

Subsequently, \in{Figure}[compose-fig:mmpose-detection] portrays a detection outcome from the MMPose model. Regrettably, the individual performing a deep squat remains undetected, while facial keypoints are erroneously identified for two adjacent individuals facing away from the camera. Despite these anomalies, the overall detection performance is commendable.

    }

Lastly, the Unified Format, primarily informed by the MMPose model, is depicted in the third figure. Notably, a single individual in the upper portion of the image remains undetected. This occurrence is attributed to the unification script, which employs an {\bf average instance visibility threshold}, set experimentally at {\bf 40\%}, to determine inclusion in the Unified Format. This threshold serves as a filter for wrongly detected human instances by one of the models. Usually this occured by the use of MMPose model which is multi-person detector and this is Nevertheless, the precision of individual detections is highly satisfactory, ensuring precise localization of keypoints when individuals are successfully detected within the image. This is proven in the evaluation \in{Section}[section:evaluation] at \at{page}[section:evaluation].

\pkap[section:evaluation]{Evaluation}
In this section, the COCO WholeBody dataset (Xu et al. 2022) will be used as a corpus for the unified detection format evaluation. Additionally, the manipulations and details regarding the processing and use of the dataset will be investigated.

As for the unified detection format evaluation, the {\bf COCO WholeBody} dataset was used. Specifically the {\bf validation 2017} subset containing {\bf 5000} images. According to a COCO WholeBody validation annotations only {\bf 2693} images has present humans. The total {\bf APE} was equal to {\bf 3.3\%}. This metric was calculated only on the matching instances of the predicted annotations concerning the ground truth annotations. This means that the differences in the predictions and the ground truth were not taken into account. Specifically the missing or additional (detection) instances in the predictions. But as for the corresponding instances, the evaluation serves as a great indicator of how well the individual detection instances were obtained. The criterion used for defining whether the instances from predictions correspond to the ground truth annotations is the \BBOX\ overlap. The threshold used for the overlap value, {\bf Intersection over Union} (\IoU\), is the {\bf 65\%}. To better understand the \IoU\ metric see the \in{Figure}[iou]. The result is very satisfactory even though the averaging of the keypoints position in the unification process causes some errors.

\obrazek{iou}{Calculation of the Intersection over Union}{figures/iou.png}{width=\makeupwidth}

There was also an evaluation on the \APE\ metric just for the {\bf MMPose} model because only this model provides us with the \BBOX\--es in the detection. The total \APE\ was: {\bf 0.95\%} which provided us with the information about the model precision on individual keypoints of detected instances. This information will be used for setting up the weights for weighted average in the process of Unified Format creation in the following \in{section}[section:unified-format] on \at{page}[section:unified-format]. Generally, the MMPose model is showing great performance on the detection tasks. Visually, there are only occasional differences in the prediction and the ground truth.

Because of the fact, that human pose estimation is a very complex task, it is required to use multiple metrics to express the performance of the detection models. For this reason, additionally, the \MSE\ and \OKS\ are evaluated as well.

The evaluation statistics for the Unified Format and MMPose model can be found in Table \in{Table}[tab:evaluation-unified-mmpose]. This table presents various values, ranging from the overall counts of processed images with ground truth annotations to differences in predicted pose counts. Easily interpretable is the \APE\ metric, indicating the average error of predicted keypoint positions relative to ground truth annotations per pose. The value of {\bf 3.3\%} for \APE\ signifies that the predicted detection closely aligns with the ground truth annotation. Conversely, the \OKS\ metric yields a somewhat concerning result, with the value of {\bf 0.23} falling towards the lower end of the metrics interval ($ <0\,,\,1> $). Generally, higher values of \OKS\ are preferable, indicative of better alignment. The Evaluation script considers a keypoint similar when the OKS for that particular keypoint exceeds the {\bf 0.45} threshold (This threshold was set experimentally.).

For a comprehensive understanding of these values, including \MSE, reference examples of images and their individual metrics in Figures \in[compose-fig:mmpose-metric] and \in[compose-fig:coco-metric]. Additionally, Table \in{Table}[tab:evaluation-metric-explanation] offers detailed statistics for these two detections. The first figure illustrates a simplified version of the MMPose model output (consisting of {\bf 27 keypoints} in the Unified Format), while the second figure displays the original COCO Wholebody annotations, also in the simplified format. This comparison facilitates a deeper understanding of the available metrics.

Table \in{Table}[tab:evaluation-metric-explanation] encompasses evaluation metrics for both the MMPose detection model and the Unified Format on a specific image (\in[compose-fig:mmpose-metric]). This comparison aids in visualizing the \APE\ and \MSE\ metrics. For the MMPose detection, it is evident that the prediction closely aligns with the ground truth pose, resulting in a low \APE\ of {\bf 2.51\%}. In contrast, for the Unified Format, as depicted in \in{Figure}[compose-fig:unified-metric], the prediction is significantly inaccurate, shifted to the left bottom of the image, while the person is clearly visible in the middle. This discrepancy arises from an incorrect pose prediction by one of the models (PoseNet or MoveNet), which, during the unification process, was averaged with the correct MMPose detection, leading to an erroneous combined prediction.

Nevertheless, this serves as an excellent illustration for explaining evaluation metrics, where for this particular pose, the \APE\ is {\bf 84.22\%}, indicating a substantial deviation from the ground truth pose. Regarding the \MSE\, this pose resulted in an average squared error (Euclidean distance between preditions and ground truth.) of {\bf 53,285.03}, highlighting significant distances between the prediction and ground truth pose.

Finally, let's delve into the explanation of the \OKS\ metric. The MMPose prediction can be interpreted as a satisfactory result, with an \OKS\ value of {\bf 0.66}, positioning it in the upper part of the interval. It's notable that the \OKS\ metric demonstrates a stringent assessment criterion; even for highly similar poses, the value may not reach a high threshold, making it challenging to gauge similarity accurately.

In the author's opinion, regarding this specific image, the COCO WholeBody annotation appears insufficient, while the MMPose model's estimation of the pose seems more accurate. This assertion may elucidate the low \OKS\ value, despite the precision of the prediction.

Conversely, the Unified Format prediction receives an \OKS\ value of {\bf 0.00}, correctly indicating it as "not similar at all." This stark contrast underscores the divergence between the Unified Format prediction and the ground truth annotation.

\pkap[section:problems-limitations]{Implementation Problems and Technical Limitations}
Throughout the course of this thesis, there have been many technical limitations and implementation struggles. This section will list some of them.

The initial plan was to utilize the {\bf BodyPoseNet} (NVIDIA, 2024) detection model from {\bf NVIDIA}, which supports multi-person detection and boasts high power and precision. However, after numerous unsuccessful attempts to implement BodyPoseNet detection script, a decision was made to move forward with a different model to avoid further time constraints. The primary challenge was that BodyPoseNet necessitated an NVIDIA GPU unit in conjunction with the DeepStream toolkit. Unfortunately, the development environment for this thesis consisted of macOS {\bf Sonoma} on a {\bf 16-inch MacBook Pro with M1 Max chip and 64GB of RAM}, which lacks an NVIDIA GPU. The initial attempts to implement BodyPoseNet detection involved a virtual machine running {\em Ubuntu 22.04} on {\em Parallels Desktop}. Subsequently, this same virtual machine environment was used for all other detection models explored. Once it was discovered that detection could be performed directly on the native MacBook environment, the virtual machine was no longer required.

There are also some implementation limitations regarding the creation of the Unified Format. A~problem arises when averaging detections together, especially when some models do not provide \BBOX\ values. For instance, both PoseNet and MoveNet do not generate \BBOX\ information, making it challenging to map the appropriate detection instances for averaging. This issue is particularly pronounced in examples from the COCO evaluation subset, as illustrated in Figures \in[compose-fig:mmpose-problem], \in[compose-fig:posenet-problem], and \in[compose-fig:unified-problem].

In Figure \in[compose-fig:posenet-problem], for instance, the mapping of the jumping person from the PoseNet model in the middle of the figure is incorrectly associated with a different instance from the MMPose model, depicted as a person on the right. Consequently, the averaging of these two detections results in the placement of the detection in between in the Unified Format output. Although the unified version of the detection appears slightly distorted, it clearly demonstrates how the averaging process combines the original detections. In this specific case, the MoveNet model did not provide any results, prompting the unification script to consider only MMPose and PoseNet detections.

These issues could be addressed by implementing a custom function that compares two instances from the detection scripts and returns a similarity constant. This constant would serve as a basis for determining if the two detection instances correspond. Utilizing the \BBOX\ information provided by the MMPose model, for example, could facilitate comparison by defining an area of overlap for individual keypoints from the other two models. If a certain percentage of keypoints fit into a \BBOX\ (for example, 65\%, similar to an \IoU\ threshold introduced in \in{Section}[section:evaluation]), the instances would be considered corresponding.
